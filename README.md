# Collecting Dust README

The intention of this project is both to learn, specifically React & Node, and to have an aesthetically pleasing way to view & manage my record collection. 

#### Product Description

* View Collection (A) & Wantlist (B)
* Display records as album covers in a grid
* When clicked, the album cover will flip (animation) & display written details about the record. For albums in the collection, it will also display release details & notes (ie the story of how it was purchased or nostalgic associations to the music)
* Sorting options include: 
	* Artist (Alphabetically & Then Chronologically by album)
	* Chronologically (Release Date)
	* Album (Alphabetically)
* When you search or focus on a particular set of items (artist, year, etc) the albums that do not pertain to the search collapse & only their side is displayed (kind of like the way you naturally store records)
* Discogs API ?

#### Dependencies

So far, none.
